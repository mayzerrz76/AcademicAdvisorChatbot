BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Configure python interpreter to Python 3.8 (although other interpreters seem to work in a jiffy)

To gain access to the framework connecting the frontend javascript and backend python code, execute the terminal command: $ pip install Flask

In an IDE of your choice (we suggest PyCharm) run main.py and click the development server url which is printed to the python console. 

Enjoy.
